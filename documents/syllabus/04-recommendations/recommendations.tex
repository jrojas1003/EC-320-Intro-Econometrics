\section*{RECOMMENDATIONS\footnote{Inspired from Professor Ed Rubin}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Be kind
    \item \textbf{Take responsibility} for your own education and try to \textbf{learn} as much as you can
    \item \textbf{Do your own work}
    \item Develop your own \textbf{intuition}
    \item Learn \texttt{R}. Struggle while you try and use Google or LLMs to figure things out
    \item Come to \textbf{Office Hours} and be ready to ask questions
    \item Don't wait until the end of the term to ask for help
    \item Start problem sets \textbf{early} -- so you can come ask for help
\end{enumerate}

Notify me if there are aspects of the course that pose disability-related barriers to your participation. 
If you require special accommodation for a documented disability, then you must go through the Accessible Education Center (AEC) so they can formally provide me notice and details of the appropriate accommodations. 
Please make these arrangements by the end of Week 1.
