Grades for this class will be assigned based on the following assignments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Weekly homework assignments (Problem Sets and Quizzes)
    \item One Midterm Exam
    \item One Final Exam
\end{itemize}
Final course grades are subject to a curve, although it largely depends on the class performance. 
The weights for the final grade are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lc}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Percentage} \\
\midrule
Quizzes       & 20\% \\
Problem sets  & 20\% \\
Midterm exam  & 30\% \\
Final exam    & 30\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Note:} 
While assignments will be submitted on Canvas, due to any potential curving of final grades, the gradebook may be not be accurate -- only an approximation. 
All adjustments of final grades will be done in a local spreadsheet.
