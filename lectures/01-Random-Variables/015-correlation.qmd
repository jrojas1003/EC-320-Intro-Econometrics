## Definition {.small}

An issue with covariance is that the covariance between two random variables depends on the units those variables are measured in.
That's where correlation comes in:

Correlation is another measure of linear association that has the benefit of being dimensionless because the units in the numerator cancel with the units in the denominator.

It is also the case that the correlation between two variables is always between -1 and 1. 
Where correlation = 1, the two variables have a perfect positive linear relationsihp, and when correlation = -1, the two variables have a perfect negative linear relationship.

We will use the greek letter $\rho$ ("rho") to refer to the correlation between two RVs.
The formula is:

\begin{align*}
    \rho_{XY} = 
    \dfrac{
        \sigma_{XY}
    }{
        \sqrt{\sigma_{X}^{2}\sigma_{Y}^{2}}
    }
\end{align*}
