If you have any data science experience, you will quickly realize that `dplyr` is nothing new. 

It is actually just `SQL`, a language for querying databases that has been around since the '70s. 

We will not be write any `SQL` but you should know that by learning `dplyr`, you are also learning `SQL`.
