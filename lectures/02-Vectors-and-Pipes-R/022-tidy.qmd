## Vectors

In R, data is held in vectors. 
You can construct a vector using the function `c()`. 
`c` is short for "combine". 

You can combine elements to form a vector, for example:

::: {.fragment}
- Combine numbers to form a numeric vector:

```{r}

c(5,3,9)
```
:::

::: {.fragment}
- Combine character strings to form a character vector:

```{r}

c("apple", "banana", "strawberry")
```

::: {.small}
> [Note: character strings need quotes around them. numbers should not have quotes around them]{.note}
