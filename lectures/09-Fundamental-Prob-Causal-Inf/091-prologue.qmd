## Statistics Inform Policy

[Policy:]{.hi} In 2017, the University of Oregon started requiring first-year students to live on campus.

. . .

[Rationale:]{.hi} First-year students who live on campus fare better:

- _[80 percent]{.hii} more likely_ to graduate in four years.
- Second-year retention rate _[5 percentage points higher]{.hii}_.
- GPAs _[0.13 points higher]{.hii}_, on average. 

. . .

_Do these comparisons suggest the policy improves student outcomes?_

. . .

_Do they describe the effect of living on campus?_

. . .

_Do they describe something else?_

## Other Things Equal

The UO's interpretation of those comparisons warrants skepticism.

- The decision to live on campus is probably related to family wealth and interest in school.
- Family wealth and interest in school are related to academic achievement.

. . .

[Why might I be worried?]{.hi} 

: The difference in outcomes between those on and off campus is not an [_all else equal_]{.note} comparison.

[Upshot:]{.hi} Can't attribute the difference in outcomes solely to living on campus.

But parental income ([W]{.hi}) impacts both student welfare ([Y]{.hi}) and living on campus ([D]{.hi}). [Failing to account for parental income will bias comparisons]{.fragment}

## All else equal

> _Ceteris paribus_, _all else held constant_, _etc_.

. . .

[A high bar]{.hi}

When [all else equal]{.note}, statistical comparisons detect causal relationships.

(Micro)economics has developed a comparative advantage in understanding where [_all else equal_]{.note} comparisons can and cannot be made.

- Anyone can retort "_correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation_."
- Understanding _why_ is difficult, but useful for learning from data.
