## Selection Bias

[Problem:]{.hi} Selection bias precludes *all else equal* comparisons.

- To make causal statements, we need to shut down the bias term.

. . .

[Potential solution:]{.hi} Conduct an experiment.

- How? [Random assignment of treatment]{.hii}

- Hence the name, [*randomized* control trial]{.note} (RCT).

. . .

Groups will need to be large enough

- Following the LLN, as we increase $n$ of both groups, our randomly assigned treatment estimate is _more likely_ to be representative of the population mean.

## Randomized control trials 

[Ex.]{.ex} [Effect of de-worming on attendance]{.hi}

<br>

[Motivation:]{.hi-bb} Intestinal worms are common among children in less-developed countries. The parasitic symptoms disrupt human capital acquisition by keeping children home.

<br>

[Policy Question:]{.hii} Do school-based de-worming interventions provide a cost-effective way to increase school attendance?

[Ex.]{.ex} [Effect of de-worming on attendance]{.hi}

<br>

[Research Question:]{.hi} How much do de-worming interventions increase school attendance?

<br>[Q:]{.note} Could we simply compare average attendance among children with and without access to de-worming medication?

. . .

<br>[A:]{.note} If we're after the causal effect, probably not.

## Randomized Control Trials 

[Ex.]{.ex} [Effect of de-worming on attendance]{.hi}

. . .

Imagine an [RCT]{.note} where we have [two]{.hi} groups of villages:

- [Treatment:]{.hii} Where children get de-worming medication in school.
- [Control:]{.hp} Where children don't get de-worming medication in school _(status quo)_.

. . .

By randomizing, we will, on average, include all kinds of villages in both groups

- poor _vs._ less poor
- access to clean water _vs._ contaminated water
- hospital _vs._ no hospital

## Randomized Control Trials 

[Ex.]{.ex} [Effect of de-worming on attendance]{.hi}

We can estimate the [causal effect]{.hi} of de-worming on school attendance by comparing the average attendance rates in the treatment group (ðŸ’Š) with those in the control group (no ðŸ’Š).

$$
\begin{align}
  \overline{\text{Attendance}}_\text{Treatment} - \overline{\text{Attendance}}_\text{Control}
\end{align}
$$

. . .


Alternatively, we can use the regression

. . .


$$
\begin{align}
  \text{Attendance}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Treatment}_i + u_i \tag{1}
\end{align}
$$

where $\text{Treatment}_i$ is a binary variable (=1 if village $i$ received the de-worming treatment).

$$
\begin{align}

\end{align}
$$

where $\text{Treatment}_i$ is a binary variable (=1 if village $i$ received the de-worming treatment).

[Q:]{.note} Should trust the results of Eq. $(1)$? [Why?]{.fragment}

. . .

<br>[A:]{.note} On average, [randomly assigning treatment should balance]{.hi} treatment and control across the other dimensions that affect school attendance.

[But we must always be cautious]{.fragment}
