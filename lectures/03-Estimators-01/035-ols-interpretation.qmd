## Interpretation

There are [two stages]{.h} of interpretation of a regression equation

1. Interpret regression estimates into words

2. Deciding whether this interpretation should be taken at face value

<br>

Both stages are important, but for now, we will focus on the first

Let's revisit our crime example

---

## Ex: Effect of Police on Crime

Using the OLS formulas, we get $\hat{\beta}_{0} = 18.41$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1} = 1.76$

## Coefficient Interpretation

How do I interpret $\hat{\beta}_{0} = 18.41$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1} = 1.76$?

The [general interpration]{.hi} of the intercept is the estimated value of $y_{i}$ when $x_{i} = 0$

And the [general interpretation]{.hi} of the slope parameter is the estimated change $y_{i}$ for the marginal increase $x_{i}$

. . .

[First]{.h}, it is important to understand the units:

- $\widehat{\text{Crime}}_{i}$ is measured as a crime [rate]{.hi}, the number of crimes per 1,000 students on campus

- $\text{Police}_{i}$ is also measured as a [rate]{.hi}, the number of police officers per 1,000 students on campus

## Coefficient Interpretation

Using OLS gives us the fitted line

$$
 \widehat{\text{Crime}_i} = \hat{\beta}_1 + \hat{\beta}_2\text{Police}_i.
$$

What does $\hat{\beta_0}$ [=]{.mono} $18.41$ tell us? [Without any police on campus, the crime rate is $18.41$ per 1,000 people on campus]{.note .fragment}

. . .

What does $\hat{\beta_1}$ [=]{.mono} $1.76$ tell us? [For each additional police officer per 1,000, there is an associated increase in the crime rate by $1.76$ crimes per 1,000 people on campus.]{.note .fragment}

. . .

_Does this mean that police [cause]{.note} crime?_ [Probably not.]{.fragment}

[This is where deciding if the interpretation should be taken at face value. It now becomes your job to bring reason to the values.]{.fragment}
